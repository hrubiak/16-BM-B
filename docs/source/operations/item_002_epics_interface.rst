It interfaces the control widgets with 16-BM-B station shutters, SR status, EPS status, most demanded
motors for user experiments, intensity monitors with ion chambers and diode, and heater power supply controller and pressure control syringe pump.

.. note:: Please be aware that when entering a new value into a field in an EPICS interface, the mouse cursor must hover over the field. 
          Then the Enter key on the keyboard needs to be pressed to accept the edited value. If the mouse cursor leaves the 
          field before the Enter key is pressed the edited value will revert to the original value.
