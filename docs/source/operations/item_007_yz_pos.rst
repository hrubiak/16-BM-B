Sample Y and/or Z positions search
----------------------------------
There are 2 ways to search sample Y and/or Z positions:

(1)	Search by radiography image
(2)	Scan absorption profile


   (1)	By radiography image

      - Switch to :ref:`radiography measurement mode <radiography_mode>`.
      - Narrow slit size to those of EDXD measurement.
      - Mark the narrow slit size and position by tape or something on monitor.
      - Open slit (click 'for Camera') for radiography measurement.
      - Move sample position to x-ray beam position shown by a mark on monitor.


   (2)	By scan

      - Move to :ref:`EXDX measurement mode <edxd_mode>`.
      - Confirm 2TH is >10Â°.
      - Open 'Bluediamond' (:ref:`Bluediamond <bluediamond>` software).
      - Select 'IC2 or Diode' in Detector in Bluediamond, uncheck all others.
      - Open 'scan' on SAM Y (or Z)

      - Set scan parameters of 'Start', 'End' and '#Pts' (#Pts has to be odd number) (confirm 'Relative').
