PEC sample assembiles
=====================

The HPCAT 16BM-B beamline hosts a Paris-Edinburgh (PE) press that allows 
standardized sample asseblies to be pressurized and heated while conducting 
*in-situ* x-ray characterization. This section describes different types of PE 
experiments and optimized sample assemblies.
